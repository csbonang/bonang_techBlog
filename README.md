## Description 
-------------------
The techblog allows the user to login, create their own tech account, and 
view their tech blog posts. 

A few other things to note: 

MVC: Model View Controller 
design pattern: helps with libraries and stacks 
handlebars 

Each section of a program addresses a seperate concern 
model: stores data and data-related logic 
view: in charge of UI and UX 
Controller processes requests from the view and sends the data to view to render 
pass between model and view 

Handlebar: 
template engine allows us to combine data with a static template to generate dynamic HTML
